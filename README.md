This project isn't just a game; it's a technical model of yield-generating assets. It simulates:

Distribution Mandates: Modeling SEBI’s 90% NDCF distribution rule.

Yield Analysis: Tracking cash-on-cash returns across different asset classes (Office, Retail, Power, and Roads).

Macroeconomic Impact: Simulating how RBI interest rate shifts affect trust financing and investor distributions.

Risk Metrics: Incorporating real-world data like WALE (Weighted Average Lease Expiry) and Occupancy Rates.

🛠️ Technical Implementation

Architecture: Built as a single-page application (SPA) using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

Logic Engine: Features a conditional event system where "Chance" cards interact dynamically with the player's specific portfolio holdings.

Human-in-the-Loop: Designed to be used alongside an external Excel ledger for manual portfolio tracking, calculating CAGR and realized gains.
